# RecipeMaker
Two programs written in C++. FridgeSimulator is a program that allows you to store recipes via the command console and have a virtual fridge that keeps track of your food. 
The RecipeMaker is a program that uses wxwidgets to create a frontend that allows you to store recipes and keep track of your fridge, with a better display than the terminal.
Also RecipeMaker closer follows OOP styling.
